I was the sole member of my team, so this became quite a challenge. I attempted a variety of different strategies to find what worked best: I tried transposition tables, multithreading, alpha-beat pruning, etc. In the end, I implemented alpha-beta pruning with some dynamic depth prediction based upon the average amount of time per move, complete with individual heuristics for black and white based upon how each would play into the early, mid, and late game. Opening books would have significantly improved the AI's performance, however I ran into a number of issues implementing them. Multithreading ought to have been a performance boost but ultimately ended up hindering the AI's ability to defeat its opponents. The strategies I implemented were simple, but given Cassio's performance thus far, it should be ready for the tournament; the detail I put into the fundamental heuristic governing how the AI works at its very basis will hopefully yield decent results. With further effort, I'm sure the AI will come to make a worthy foe.
